        Note:

            The linked list will have at least two elements.
            All of the nodes' values will be unique.
            The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
            Do not return anything from your function.

        Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
        Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:


         */

        public static void DeleteNode(ListNode node)
        {
            if (node == null || node.next == null)
                return;

            node.val = node.next.val;
            node.next = node.next.next;
        }

    }
